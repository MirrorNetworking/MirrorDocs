# 2023 Change Log

{% hint style="info" %}
Mirror is published to the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321) at the start of every month, unless some critical issue causes a delay.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Mirror uses semantic versioning, and the versions shown here are those that were published to the Asset Store, and occasionally major version bumps happen mid-month between store submissions and are therefore not individually shown here.
{% endhint %}

* Fixed: Several updates to `PredictedRigidbody` and materials handling
* Fixed: `PredictedRigidbody` Visual rotation interpolation now works correctly.

## [v86.13.0](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror/releases/tag/v86.13.0) -- 2023-Dec-12

* Added: `NetworkDiagnosticsDebugger` to log messages sent and received.
* Added: `NetworkPingDisplay` now shows Connection Quality.
* Added: `PredictedRigidbody` visual interpolation object.
* Added: LayerMask support in Network Reader / Writer
* Added: Network Manager now has toggle to disable Auto-Start Headless Server / Client in Editor.
* Added: Network Manager now has toggle to not disconnect client on message exceptions.
* Added: Network Manager now has a Populate Spawnable Prefabs button.
* Added: Utils now has `isWebGL` and `isDebug`.
* Added: SimpleWebTransport now returns remote address from reverse proxy when available.
* Added: Additional examples have been added.
* Fixed: Edgegap Hosting registry, image name, and tag strings are trimmed to avoid errors from trailing whitespace.
* Fixed: SyncVar hook invocations no longer instantiate a new Action delegate on every call.
* Fixed: Ping messages now include scene hash to prevent high RTT after long scene load.
* Fixed: `NetworkTransform` `OnTeleport` no longer calls `Reset`, which cause `NT Reliable` deltas to get out of sync.
* Fixed: `NetworkBehaviour` `authority` now correctly evaluates for host client.
* Fixed: `LatencySimulation` now correctly applies latency to both channels.
* Fixed: Message ID hashing improved to minimize collisions.
* Changed: EdgeGap Plugin updated to version 2.
* Changed: Network Manager Auto-Start Headless was refactored.
* Changed: Multiplex Transport is now a `PortTransport`.
* Changed: Some examples now use `NetworkTransformReliable`.
* Changed: `NetworkTransformReliable` now has toggle for rotation compression.
* Changed: `NetworkTransformReliable` now always uses bandwidth savings.
* Changed: Some duplicated scripts in Examples consolidated to \_Common folder.
* Changed: `ConnectionQuality` moved to `NetworkClient`.
* Changed: `GUIConsole` layout updated to not collide with `NetworkHUD`.
  * Default hotkey changed to tick (`` ` ``) for safer use in WebGL builds.
* Changed: KCP Transport `ToString` now include port.

* **Breaking Changes**
  * SimpleWebTransport Settings and Logging have been refactored.
    * There are now separate port fields for server and clients so you don't have to change them for building server and client.
  * SimpleWebTransport Use of cert.json and SSL certs has been labeled as obsolete in the component inspector.
    * This feature will be removed eventually.  Reverse Proxy should always be implemented as it performs far better and is easier to maintain.
